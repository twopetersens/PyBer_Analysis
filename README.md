# Overview of the Analysis
  The purpose of the analysis was to summarize how weekly ride fare differs between city types using number of drivers, fare collected and "city type," being Urban, Suburban and Rural. The analysis was to include a line graph that showed the total weekly fares by city type.

## Anlysis Results for Fares Collected Weekly

###### Rural - The numbers that matter the most: 78 drivers, $55.49 average fare. Lower population density puts a premium on drivers willing to make the trip from a denser population area to a more sparsley populated area. The premium on being in lower population density and needing a ride back to the area is noted.   

###### Suburban - The numbers that matter the most: Total rides 625, $39.50 average fare. Closer to population density, more drivers willing to make the commute in to town to surrounding areas.

###### Urban - The numbers that matter the most: 2,405 drivers to 1,625 rides needed. Labor saturation reflected in Fare Per Driver at $16.57 vs. $55.49 in rural areas.
  
## Summary of Analysis
  
  The analysis was able to report that, based on the line graph, fee collection over time, when compared to differing city types, the revenue collected correlates tangentily, meaning, regardless of whether you're rural or suburban or urban, if you're a driver, or trying to identify trends, no matter where you are, if business is going to pick up, it's going to pick up across the board. (That was not a run-on sentence. Grammatically.) All areas. So from a business standpoint, it looks like it would make sense to incentivize the urban drivers to do more work in the suburban and rural markets, thus de-saturating the urban areas, and possibly equalizing the rate of return between the 2,405 urban drivers and the 78 rural drivers. But with that move, it may be difficult to, or you would have to, address why there are 78 drivers in a rural market and 2,405 in an urban, from a housing standpoint. Saturation of market could, possibly, be a result of other income and mobility based factors.
